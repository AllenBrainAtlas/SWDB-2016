%---
% display a sentence that talks about some number, and but nouns/verbs at
% the appropriate singular or plural form according to those numbers
%
% the parts of this sentence that are variable must be written initially in
% upper case and plural form (except when the plural form is empty: in this
% latter case, write in upper case and singular form)
%
% exemple:
% >> fn_singular('We found ',3,' occurenceS, among which ',2,' WERE A perfect matchES.')
% We found 3 occurences, among which 2 were perfect matches.
% >> fn_singular('We found ',3,' occurenceS, among which ',1,' WERE A perfect matchES.')
% We found 3 occurences, among which 1 was a perfect match.
% >> fn_singular('We found ',1,' occurenceS, among which ',1,' WERE A perfect matchES.')
% We found 1 occurence, among which 1 was a perfect match.
